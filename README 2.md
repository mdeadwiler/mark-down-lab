## ***Rules and how to play the game***

+ This NFL-themed memory game challenges players to match current NFL players hidden behind a grid of squares. Players will select squares, trying to find matching pairs within 8 attempts. Each round consists of 12 squares, and you'll have 16 seconds to make your selections. With each new round, the time to complete your matches decreases, raising the stakes. To win, you must successfully match three pairs in a row. Each NFL player will have a voice over if the matches are correct!

#### ***MVP***

+ NFL match game where the player will have 3 rounds of timed match making chances of relevant nfl players today.

>> My Stretch Goals:
   Screen shakes each round. However, each round the screen becomes more intense
   Sped up timer each round
   Audio voice over of the NFL player after the match
   If th round is lost, a voice over will trigger something negative to the user.
